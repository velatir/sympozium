# Skills & Sidecars

Most agent frameworks dump every tool into one shared process. One bad `kubectl delete` and your whole agent environment is toast. Sympozium does this completely differently.

## Isolated Skill Sidecars

**Every skill runs in its own sidecar container** — a separate, isolated process injected into the agent pod at runtime. Use skills to give agents cluster-admin capabilities (`kubectl`, `helm`, scaling) or domain-specific tools — each with ephemeral least-privilege RBAC that's garbage-collected when the run finishes. Toggle a skill on, and the controller automatically:

- Injects a dedicated sidecar container with only the binaries that skill needs (`kubectl`, `helm`, `terraform`, etc.)
- Provisions **ephemeral, least-privilege RBAC** scoped to that single agent run — no standing permissions, no god-roles
- Shares a `/workspace` volume so the agent can coordinate with the sidecar
- **Garbage-collects everything** when the run finishes — containers, roles, bindings, all gone

> _"Give the agent tools, not trust."_ — Skills get exactly the permissions they declare, for exactly as long as the run lasts, and not a second longer.

## How Sidecars Are Injected

```
Agent has skills: [k8s-ops]
  → AgentRun created
    → Controller resolves SkillPack "k8s-ops"
      → Finds sidecar: { image: skill-k8s-ops, rbac: [...] }
      → Injects sidecar container into pod
      → Creates Role + RoleBinding (namespace-scoped)
      → Creates ClusterRole + ClusterRoleBinding (cluster-wide access)
    → Pod runs with kubectl + RBAC available
    → On completion/deletion: all skill RBAC cleaned up
```

## Built-in Tools

Every agent pod has these tools available out of the box (no skill sidecar required for native tools):

| Tool | Type | Description |
|------|------|-------------|
| `execute_command` | IPC (sidecar) | Execute shell commands (`kubectl`, `bash`, `curl`, `jq`, etc.) in the skill sidecar container |
| `read_file` | Native | Read file contents from the pod filesystem |
| `write_file` | Native | Create or overwrite files under `/workspace` or `/tmp` |
| `edit_file` | Native | Apply one or more exact-string replacements to a file, sequentially and all-or-nothing (each old_string must match the current contents uniquely) |
| `list_directory` | Native | List directory contents with type, size, and name |
| `fetch_url` | Native | Fetch web pages or API endpoints. HTML is converted to readable plain text |
| `send_channel_message` | IPC (bridge) | Send a message through a connected channel |
| `schedule_task` | IPC (bridge) | Create, update, suspend, resume, or delete recurring `SympoziumSchedule` tasks |

!!! note
    **Native** tools run directly in the agent container. **IPC** tools communicate with sidecars or the IPC bridge via the shared `/ipc` volume. See the [Tool Authoring Guide](../guides/writing-tools.md) for how to add your own, or the [Tool Sidecar Authoring Guide](../sidecars/writing-tool-sidecars.md) to build a custom sidecar that processes IPC calls.

## Native Sidecar Tools

`execute_command` is universal, but it asks the model to hand-build a shell string —
`execute_command(target="my-skill", command="node /app/cli.js evaluate web ...")`.
Smaller and non-Anthropic models frequently get the quoting wrong. A **native sidecar
tool** instead exposes a single sidecar operation to the model as a typed,
function-calling tool with a JSON Schema. The model just fills in structured arguments
(`sd_evaluate_changes({serviceIdentifier: "web"})`) and the runtime turns that into the
right invocation against the owning sidecar.

You declare these on the SkillPack itself, under `spec.sidecar.tools[]` — no extra
sidecar code is required beyond the standard `tool-executor.sh`. The key idea is the
**trust boundary**:

- **Operator-authored, not agent-authored.** Tool definitions live on the SkillPack CRD.
  The controller serializes them into a **read-only, immutable ConfigMap** mounted into
  the agent. The agent consumes the manifest but cannot forge or alter it.
- **The executable is declared, not chosen by the model.** The model only supplies
  arguments; the binary that runs is fixed by the operator.
- **No more authority than `execute_command`.** Dispatch flows through the same gated
  exec IPC, and arguments are delivered in *argv mode* (no shell) — a value like
  `"; rm -rf /"` is passed as one literal argument, never interpreted.

A native tool therefore grants the model a cleaner interface, not more power. See
[Native Sidecar Tools](../sidecars/writing-tool-sidecars.md#native-sidecar-tools) for the full
authoring reference and security model.

## Built-in SkillPacks

## Toggling Skills

```bash
# In the TUI: press 's' on an instance → Space to toggle skills
# Or via kubectl:
kubectl patch agent <name> --type=merge \
  -p '{"spec":{"skills":[{"skillPackRef":"k8s-ops"},{"skillPackRef":"llmfit"}]}}'
```
