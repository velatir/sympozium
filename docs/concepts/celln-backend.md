# Celln Backend (Hermetic Execution)

Sympozium optionally integrates with [Celln](https://github.com/sympozium-ai/celln) to run a single bounded, high-risk, or sensitive computation in a hardware-isolated microVM instead of a Kubernetes Job. It is selected per run with `spec.backend: "celln"` on an `AgentRun`.

Celln is **opt-in**: `celln.enabled=false` by default in the Helm chart, because the installer DaemonSet it deploys runs privileged, with `hostPID`, and a read-write mount of the host root filesystem — necessary to set up KVM on the host, but a materially different trust boundary than the rest of Sympozium's pods. Enable it explicitly with `sympozium install --enable-hermetic-workloads` (or `helm upgrade --set celln.enabled=true`). This page covers what that turns on, and the one requirement that's easy to miss: Celln needs its own AI provider access on the host, separate from whatever provider your `Agent`/`AgentRun` is configured with.

The web UI's Runs page shows a live banner if any listed run uses `backend: celln` while the router is unreachable, and the New Run dialog checks live reachability when you select the Celln backend — both backed by `GET /api/v1/capabilities`.

## What Celln is (and isn't)

Celln runs one task in a sealed KVM cell and returns a bounded text result. It deliberately does **not** support ensembles, delegation, shared memory, IPC, NATS, streaming, or sub-agent spawns — anything that needs those capabilities must use the standard `job` backend (or `agentSandbox`; see [Agent Sandboxing](agent-sandbox.md)). Use it for individual computations you'd rather not run un-sandboxed: parsing untrusted input, running generated code, one-off risky operations.

```yaml
apiVersion: sympozium.ai/v1alpha1
kind: AgentRun
metadata:
  name: risky-computation
spec:
  agentRef: my-agent
  task: "Parse this untrusted file and summarize its structure"
  backend: celln
  timeout: "5m"
```

## How It Works

```
AgentRun (backend: celln)
  │
  ├─ Controller POSTs {id, task, timeout} to CELLN_ROUTER_URL
  │   (celln-router.celln-system.svc.cluster.local:8787)
  │
  ├─ Router (one pod per KVM node) forwards to the host-level
  │   celln dispatcher — a systemd service on that node, installed
  │   by the celln-installer DaemonSet
  │
  └─ Dispatcher asks its configured AI provider to write a program,
     attests and seals it into a real KVM cell, runs it, and returns
     the bounded output. status.cellnActionId tracks the poll.
```

The installer and router only schedule onto nodes labeled `celln.dev/kvm: "true"` — Celln needs `/dev/kvm` and is not a container-level isolation mechanism, so it can't run on arbitrary nodes the way the `job` backend can.

## Trust model: your task always runs in the agent lane

Celln draws a hard line between two authority levels for code running inside a cell: the **tool lane** (an already-attested host binary, sealed in read-only — full but narrow authority) and the **agent lane** (agent-authored code, generated at run time — gets only what's explicitly loaned to it, permanently, no matter how well it's built). Full model: [tool lane](https://sympozium-ai.github.io/celln/tool-lane.html) / [agent lane](https://sympozium-ai.github.io/celln/agent-lane.html).

A Sympozium `backend: celln` `AgentRun` **always executes in the agent lane.** The controller always sends the task as a `forge` request — a model writes a program from the task string, it gets rebuilt twice and hash-compared — and that program is `author=agent` by construction, which is agent-lane authority regardless of how cleanly it reproduces. There is currently no `AgentRun` field for naming a pre-declared, hash-pinned tool instead of a task string, so tool-lane execution isn't reachable from Sympozium today — only from the `celln` CLI directly (`celln spec` / `celln run`). Practically, that means every `backend: celln` run gets: no ambient host tools or filesystem beyond its own generated program and workspace, no persisted workspace between runs (`workspace: "none"`), a fixed 256MiB/64KiB memory/output envelope (not yet configurable per run), and hardware isolation with no softer fallback. See [Sympozium × Celln actions](https://sympozium-ai.github.io/celln/sympozium-celln-actions.html) for the full breakdown of what the dispatched request actually contains.

## Enabling / Disabling Celln

```bash
sympozium install --enable-hermetic-workloads
# or: make install ENABLE_HERMETIC_WORKLOADS=true
# or: helm upgrade --install sympozium charts/sympozium/ --set celln.enabled=true ...
```

```yaml
# values.yaml — the master switch, false by default
celln:
  enabled: false
```

When `false` (the default), no `celln-system` namespace, installer, or router is deployed, and the controller/apiserver aren't given a router URL — zero footprint.

**Disabling it does not remove `"celln"` as a valid `backend` value on the CRD.** A run submitted with `backend: celln` while disabled will still be admitted; the controller will attempt to reach the router at the default in-cluster DNS name, fail to resolve it, and the run transitions to `Failed` with a router-unreachable error. If you disable Celln after enabling it, communicate that to whoever authors `AgentRun`s or agent defaults that set `backend: celln` — or watch for the live banner on the Runs page, which flags exactly this case.

## Enabling Celln: the AI provider requirement

This is the part that's easy to miss: **Celln's AI provider is configured independently of your `Agent`/`AgentRun`'s `model:` field.** A celln-backed run's task string goes to whatever provider is configured on the KVM *host* — the run's own `model.provider`/`model.name` are not passed through and are ignored for this backend.

The host-level dispatcher (not the Sympozium controller) needs one of:

- **An API key**, set via Helm — mounted into the `celln-installer` DaemonSet as a Secret, and written to `/etc/celln/agent-key` on the host for the dispatcher to read:
  ```yaml
  celln:
    anthropicApiKey: "sk-ant-..."   # needs the `claude` CLI on the host
    # openaiApiKey: "sk-..."        # needs the `codex` CLI on the host
    # deepseekApiKey: "sk-..."      # no CLI needed, plain API calls
    # openaiBaseUrl: ""             # optional, for an OpenAI-compatible proxy
  ```
  Set **one** of these. `anthropicApiKey`/`openaiApiKey` still require the corresponding CLI (`claude`/`codex`) to actually be installed and authenticated on the KVM node — the key alone isn't sufficient if the CLI is missing.

- **A locally running `ollama`** with a model already pulled, and no key set at all. The dispatcher auto-discovers it.

- **Nothing set** — the dispatcher searches the host for any authenticated CLI (`codex`, `claude`, `deepseek-api`, `ollama`, in that order) at startup and uses the first one it finds.

If none of the above is true on a given KVM node, that node's dispatcher is still installed and healthy from Kubernetes' point of view (the router's health check only verifies `/dev/kvm` and non-empty tool/mote stores, not provider availability) — the failure only surfaces when a task is actually dispatched, as an AgentRun `Failed` status with the provider's own auth error (e.g. *"`claude` has no saved login and ANTHROPIC_API_KEY is not set — authenticate it or set a key"*).

## Graceful Degradation

| Scenario | Behavior |
|----------|----------|
| `celln.enabled=false` | No `celln-system` namespace or resources. Runs with `backend: celln` fail at dispatch with a router-unreachable error, not at admission. |
| `celln.enabled=true`, no node labeled `celln.dev/kvm=true` | Installer/router DaemonSets deploy with zero pods scheduled. Runs fail the same way as above — nothing is listening at the router URL. |
| `celln.enabled=true`, KVM node(s) present, no AI provider reachable on the host | Router and dispatcher report healthy. The run reaches `Running`, then fails once the dispatcher's own provider check fails — see above. |
| Everything configured | Run dispatches, executes in a real sealed cell, and returns a bounded result. |
